*scenarios 

powershell :
	understanding why powershell script wont work :
		created a ps script with a basic ping command 
		executing script open ps window and closes it immediately 
		to debug what is going on, we use win + R and then put the following command
		PowerShell -NoExit "C:\Users\ferta\source\repos\fhoussam\Mt\StartAngular.ps1"
		Error message is clearer and we understood that we dont have some kind of access
		turned out we needed to execute the following command to allow ps to execute on ther machine 
		run ps with admin mode and run : set-executionpolicy remotesigned
